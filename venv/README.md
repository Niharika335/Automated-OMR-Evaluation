# Automated OMR Evaluation & Scoring System (Theme 1)

## Problem statement
Automate evaluation of standardized OMR sheets captured by mobile phone camera. The system produces per-subject scores (0–20 each) and a total score (0–100), and exports results for audit.

## What this repo contains
- `app.py` — Streamlit demo app (upload image, run OMR, see overlay & scores)
- `omr.py` — Core OMR processing (fiducial detection, perspective warp, bubble analysis, scoring)
- `template_generator.py` — Generates a sample template image, sample filled sheet, and a warped sample (for demo)
- `sample_data/` — generated by `template_generator.py`
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git (for pushing to GitHub)
- Optional: Streamlit account (for deployment)

## Quick local setup (Linux/macOS/Windows)
1. Clone repo:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
